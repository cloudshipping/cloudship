//! Traits to construct text-based messages

//------------ Scribe -------------------------------------------------------

/// A trait for something into which text-messages can be assembled.
///
/// A type implementing this trait serves as a buffer to assemble the message
/// before sending. Putting the message together shall be called "scribbling"
/// and types that can turn themselves into parts of such a text messages are
/// `Scribble`s. 
///
/// Note that this here isnâ€™t serialization (which is why different terms
/// have been chosen) since there is no generic way to express any Rust type.
/// Only specific types can be scribbled.
///
/// The trait provides implementations for a few builtin primitive types in
/// a way typical for Internet messages. You can overide these of necessary
/// for your specific format.
///
